# Flight finder

I was frustrated by a recent experience trying to compare flight prices for different European destinations. Price flights often dictate where I want to travel.

This is a tool to compare different flight price information across multiple cities.

Aims of this tool

- Provide an easy to user interface to compare flight prices of multiple destinations
- Use Skyscanner API and / or other flight price info to retrieve flight info
- Allow user to enter multiple cities
- Allow users to enter just one country and show flights for every airport in that country
